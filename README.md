# Zomato Clone

This is the clone of a popular food ordering website [Zomato](https://www.zomato.com/)
As a part of my 6-Week long Front Development internship with Edunet foundation and IBM Skillsbuild, I have built a Front End UI of Zomato Website. 
This repository contains the source code for a front-end clone of Zomato, a popular food delivery platform, built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The project aims to replicate the user interface and functionality of the Zomato application, providing a hands-on experience with modern web development practices.
